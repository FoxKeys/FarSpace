FarSpace
========

PHP clone (another implementation but same idea and gameplay) of Sourceforge "Outer Space" project.

Unlike of OSpace this project is PHP + mysql, have relational (not object) data structure and REST-like (not RPC) API.
Features of this approach:
1. Higher code speed and game-server throughput (more galaxies and players per server);
2. Much more simple and robust code (FOREIGN-keys constraints, not-stored, but fast calculated props);
3. Game Client can be written on any language having HTTP;
4. PHP + mysql server much easier to setup;
5. Browser game client can work on almost any platform;

Developers velcome.
